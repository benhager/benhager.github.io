🚗 “The key to that success is looser safety rules that let Luminar’s lasers fire pulses 40 times more powerful at 1550 nm than 905-nm lasers are allowed to fire in a conventional car. That extra power extends the long-wavelength lidar’s range by a factor of 10 and its resolution a factor of 50. That extra margin makes a big difference at highway speeds—at 75 miles per hour, a car travels 34 meters in a second…” – [Under the Hood of Luminar's Long-Reach Lidar - IEEE Spectrum](http://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/self-driving/under-the-hood-of-luminars-long-reach-lidar)

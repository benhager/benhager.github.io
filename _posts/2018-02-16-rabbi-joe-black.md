[Rabbi Joe Black: Opening Prayer For the Colorado State House in the Aftermath of a Tragedy](https://rabbijoeblack.blogspot.com/2018/02/opening-prayer-for-colorado-state-house.html)

> On this tragic day when we confront the aftermath of the 18th School shooting in our nation on the 46th day of this year, I do not feel like praying.
> Our prayers have not stopped the bullets.
> Our prayers have changed nothing.
